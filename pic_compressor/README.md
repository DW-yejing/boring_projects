## 1. Overview

This document details an efficient PNG image compression method that significantly reduces file size while maintaining the original image dimensions, color quality, and transparency. In practice, this method can compress a 44KB PNG image to approximately 9KB, achieving a compression ratio of around 80%.

## 2. Compression Principles

### 2.1 Color Mode Conversion

- Convert image to 8-bit palette mode (P mode)
- Use median cut algorithm (method=2) for color quantization
- Reserve 255 colors for image content, 1 color for transparency channel
- Maintain color quality through optimized quantization algorithm

### 2.2 Transparency Processing

- Process alpha channel independently to avoid color distortion
- Binarize alpha channel:
  - Threshold at 128
  - Pixels below threshold set to fully transparent (0)
  - Pixels at or above threshold set to fully opaque (255)
- Use last palette index (255) specifically for transparent color
- Preserve original color information in transparent areas

### 2.3 Compression Strategy

- Use maximum DEFLATE compression level (level 9)
- Enable PNG optimization (optimize=True)
- Separate color quantization and transparency processing for optimal results

## 3. Experiments

### 3.2 Testing

```python
python png_compressor.py # Compress specified PNG images
python compression_comparison.py # Compare with other compression methods
```

## 4. Performance Metrics

Performance on test image (260x260 pixels):

- Original size: 44.17 KB
- Compressed size: 8.89 KB
- Compression ratio: 79.87%
- Maintains original dimensions
- Preserves color quality
- Correctly handles transparency

## 5. Key Parameters

- Color count: 255 (1 reserved for transparency)
- Quantization method: Median cut (method=2)
- Alpha threshold: 128
- Compression level: 9 (maximum compression)

## 6. Use Cases

1. Best suited for:

   - Icons, logos, and images with relatively simple colors
   - UI elements requiring transparency
   - Web and mobile application interface elements
2. Advantages:

   - Maintains original image dimensions
   - Preserves good color quality
   - Correctly handles transparency
   - Significant file size reduction
3. Considerations:

   - Gradients may show slight banding
   - Complex semi-transparent effects will be binarized
   - Extremely subtle color variations may be lost

## 7. Conclusion

This compression method achieves significant file size reduction while maintaining image quality through optimized color quantization and transparency processing. By separating the handling of color and transparency, it ensures optimal compression results. The method is particularly suitable for UI elements and icons that need to be transmitted over networks, striking an excellent balance between file size and image quality.
