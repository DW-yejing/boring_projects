The ideal companion machine would not only look, feel, and sound friendly but would also be 
programmed to behave in an agreeable manner. Those qualities that   26  
 
   other people enjoyable

would be simulated as closely as possible, and the machine would appear to be    27  ,stimulating 
and easygoing. Its informal conversational style would make interaction comfortable, and yet the 
machine would remain slightly   28   and therefore interesting. In its first    29   , it might be 
somewhat hesitant and unassuming, but as it came to know the user it would progress to a more    
30    and intimate style. The machine would not be a passive     31    but would add its own 
suggestions, information, and opinions; it would sometimes     32   in developing or changing the 
topic and would have a    33   of its own.
The machine would convey presence. We have all seen how a computer’s use of personal 
names often fascinates people and needs them to treat the machine as if it were almost human. Such
features are easily written into the software. By introducing a degree of forcefulness and humour, 
the machine could    34   a vivid and unique character.
Friendships are not made in a day, and the computer would be more    35   as a friend if it 
simulated the gradual changes that occur when one person is getting to know another. At an 
appropriate time it might also express the kind of affection that stimulates attachment and intimacy.
Part Ⅲ                                        Reading Comprehension
Section A
Directions： In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word
far each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage 
through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. 
Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through 
the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
Most experts in sleep behaviour agree that there is virtually an epidemic of sleepiness in the 
nation. “I can’t think of a   36   study that hasn’t found Americans getting less sleep than they ought
to,” says Dr David.
The beginning of our sleep-deficit crisis can be    37    to the invention of the light bulb a 
century ago. From diary entries and other personal accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries, sleep
scientists have reached the    38    that the average person used to sleep about 9.5 hours a night. By 
the 1950s and 1960s, that sleep schedule had been reduced    39    to between 7.5 and 8 hours, and 
most people had to wake to an alarm clock. “People cheat on their sleep, and they don’t realise 
they’re doing it,” says Dr David. “They think they’re okay because they can get by on 6.5 hours, 
when they really need 7.5, 8 or even more to feel   40   vigorous.”
Perhaps the most merciless robber of sleep, researchers say, is the   41   of the day. Whenever 
pressures from work, family, friends and community mount, many people consider sleep the least 
expensive item on the agenda. “In our society, you’re considered   42   if you say you only need 5.5 
hours’ sleep. If you say you’ve got to get 8.5 hours, people think you lack drive and ambition.” To 
assess the    43    of sleep deficit, researchers have put subjects through a set of psychological and 
performance tests requiring them, for instance, to add columns of numbers or   44   a passage read 
to them only minutes earlier. “We’ve found that if you’re sleep-deprived, performance suffers,” 
says Dr David. “Short-term memory is   45   , so are abilities to make decisions and to concentrate.”
A) ideally
I) conclusion
B) dynamic
J) drastic
C) currently
K) expectations
D) single
L) dramatically
E) startlingly
M) recur
F) complexity
N) consequences
O) impaired

Welcome, Freshmen. Have an iPod.
[A] Taking a step that many professors may view as a bit counterproductive, some colleges and 
universities are doling out Apple iPhones and Internet-capable iPods to their students. The 
always-on Internet devices raise some novel possibilities, like tracking where students gather 
together. With far less controversy, colleges could send messages about cancelled classes, 
delayed buses, campus crises or just the cafeteria menu.
[B] While schools emphasise its usefulness — online research in class and instant polling of 
students, for example 一 a big part of the attraction is, undoubtedly, that the iPhone is cool and
a hit with students. Being equipped with one of the most recent cutting-edge IT products could
just help a college or university foster a cutting-edge reputation.
[C] Apple stands to win as well, hooking more young consumers with decades of technology 
purchases ahead of them. The lone losers, some fear, could be professors. Students already 
have laptops and cell phones, of course, but the newest devices can take class distractions to a 
new level. They practically beg a user to ignore the long-suffering professor struggling to pass 
on accumulated wisdom from the front of the room 一 a prospect that teachers find most 
irritating and students view as, well, inevitable.
[D] “When it gets a little boring, I might pull it out,” acknowledged Naomi Pugh, a first-year 
student at Freed-Hardeman University in Henderson, Tenn., referring to her new iPod Touch, 
which can connect to the Internet over a campus wireless network. She speculated that 
professors might try even harder to make classes interesting if they were to compete with the 
devices.
[E] Experts see a movement toward the use of mobile technology in education, though they say it is
in its infancy as professors try to come up with useful applications. Providing powerful hand-
held devices is sure to fuel debates over the role of technology in higher education. “We think 
this is the way the future is going to work” said Kyle Dickson, co-director of research and the 
mobile learning initiative at Abilene Christian University in Texas, which has bought more 
than 600 iPhones and 300 iPods for students entering this fall.
[F] Although plenty of students take their laptops to class, they don’t take them everywhere and 
would prefer something lighter. Abilene Christian settled on the devices after surveying 
students and finding that they did not like hauling around their laptops, but that most of them 
always carried a cell phone, Dr Dickson said.
[G] It is not clear how many colleges and universities plan to give out iPhones and iPods this fall; 
officials at Apple were unwilling to talk about the subject and said that they would not leak 
any institution’s plans. “We can’t announce other people’s news,” said Greg Joswiak, vice 
president of iPod and iPhone marketing at Apple. He also said that he could not discuss 
discounts to universities for bulk purchases.
[H] At least four institutions — the University of Maryland, Oklahoma Christian University, 
Abilene Christian and Freed-Hardeman 一 have announced that they will give the devices to 
some or all of their students this fall. Other universities are exploring their options. Stanford 
University has hired a student-run company to design applications like a campus map and 
directory for the iPhone. It is considering whether to issue iPhones but not sure it’s necessary, 
noting that more than 700 iPhones were registered on the university’s network last year. At the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, iPhones might already have been everywhere, if AT&T,
the wireless carrier offering the iPhone in the United States, had a more reliable network, said 
Andrew Yu, mobile devices platform project manager at MIT. “We would have probably gone 
ahead with this, maybe just getting a thousand iPhones and giving them out,” Mr. Yu said.
[I] The University of Maryland at College Park is proceeding cautiously, giving the iPhone or iPod 
Touch to 150 students, said Jeffrey Huskamp, vice president and chief information officer at 
the university. “We don’t think that we have all the answers,” Mr. Huskamp said. By observing
how students use the gadgets, he said, “We’re trying to get answers from the students.”
[J] At each college, the students who choose to get an iPhone must pay for mobile phone service. 
Those service contracts include unlimited data use. Both the iPhones and the iPod Touch 
4
devices can connect to the Internet through campus wireless networks. With the iPhone, those 
networks may provide faster connections and longer battery life than AT&T’s data network. 
Many cell phones allow users, to surf the Web, but only some newer ones are capable of 
wireless connection to the local area computer network.
[K] University officials say that they have no plans to track their students (and Apple said it would 
not be possible unless students give their permission). They say that they are drawn to the 
prospect of learning applications outside the classroom, though such lesson plans have yet to 
surface.
[L] “My colleagues and I are studying something called augmented reality (a field of computer 
research dealing with the combination of real-world and virtual reality)” said Christopher 
Dede, professor in learning technologies at Harvard University. “Alien Contact,” for example, 
is an exercise developed for middle-school students who use hand-held devices that can 
determine their location. As they walk around a playground or other area, text, video or audio 
pops up at various points to help them try to figure out why aliens were in the schoolyard.
[M] “You can imagine similar kinds of interactive activities along historical lines,” like following 
the Freedom Trail in Boston, Professor Dede said. “It’s important that we do research so that 
we know how well something like this works.”
[N] The rush to distribute the devices worries some professors, who say that students are less likely 
to participate in class if they are multi-tasking. “I’m not someone who’s anti-technology, but 
I’m always worried that technology becomes an end in and of itself, and it replaces teaching or
it replaces analysis,” said Ellen Millender, associate professor of classics at Reed College in 
Portland, Ore. (She added that she hoped to buy an iPhone for herself once prices fall.) Robert 
Summers, who has taught at Cornell Law School for about 40 years, announced this week — 
in a detailed, footnoted memorandum — that he would ban laptop computers from his class on
contract law. “I would ban that too if I knew the students were using it in class,” Professor 
Summers said of the iPhone, after the device and its capabilities were explained to him. “What
we want to encourage in these students is an active intellectual experience, in which they 
develop the wide range of complex reasoning abilities required of good lawyers.”
[O] The experience at Duke University may ease some concerns. A few years ago, Duke began 
giving iPods to students with the idea that they might use them to record lectures (these older 
models could not access the Internet). “We had assumed that the biggest focus of these devices
would be consuming the content,” said Tracy Futhey, vice president for information 
technology and chief information officer at Duke. But that is not all that the students did. They
began using the iPods to create their own “content”, making audio recordings of themselves 
and presenting them. The students turned what could have been a passive interaction into an 
active one, Ms Futhey said.
46.University officials claim that they dole out iPhones and iPods so as to facilitate students’ 
learning outside of class.
47.In the author’s view, being equipped with IT products may help colleges and universities build 
an innovative image.
48.Professor Robert Summers at Cornell Law School banned laptop computers from his class 
because he thinks qualified lawyers need to possess a broad array of complex reasoning abilities.
49. Naomi Pugh at Freed-Hardeman University speculated that professors would have to work 
harder to enliven their classes.
50. The University of Maryland at College Park is proceeding with caution concerning the use of 
iPhones and iPods.
51. Many professors think that giving out Apple iPhones or Internet-capable iPods to students may 
not benefit education as intended.
52. The experience at Duke University may ease some concerns because the students have used 
iPods 
for active interaction.
53. Ellen Millender at Reed College in Portland is concerned that technology will take the place of 
teaching or analysis.
54. The distribution of iPhones among students has raised concerns that they will further distract 
5
students from class participation.
55. Experts like Dr Kyle Dickson at Abilene Christian University think that mobile technology will 
be more widely used in education.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or 
unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You 
should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a 
single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
In 2011, many shoppers chose to avoid the frantic crowds and do their holiday shopping from 
the comfort of their computer. Sales at online retailers gained by more than 15%, making it the 
biggest season ever. But people are also returning those purchases at record rates, up 8% from last 
year.
What went wrong? Is the lingering shadow of the global financial crisis making it harder to 
accept extravagant indulgences? Or that people shop more impulsively — and therefore make bad 
decisions — when online? Both arguments are plausible. However, there is a third factor: a 
question of touch. We can love the look but, in an online environment, we cannot feel the quality of
a texture, the shape of the fit, the fall of a fold or, for that matter, the weight of an earring. And 
physically interacting with an object makes you more committed to your purchase. 
When my most recent book Brandwashed was released, I teamed up with a local bookstore to 
conduct an experiment about the differences between the online and offline shopping experience. I 
carefully instructed a group of volunteers to promote my book in two different ways. The first was 
a fairly hands-off approach. Whenever a customer would inquire about my book, the volunteer 
would take him over to the shelf and point to it. Out of 20 such requests, six customers proceeded 
with the purchase.
The second option also involved going over to the shelf but, this time, removing the book and 
then subtly holding onto it for just an extra moment before placing it in the customer’s hands. Of 
the 20 people who were handed the book, 13 ended up buying it. Just physically passing the book 
showed a big difference in sales. Why? We feel something similar to a sense of ownership when we
hold things in our hand. That’s why we establish or reestablish connection by greeting strangers and
friends with a handshake. In this case, having to then let go of the book after holding it might 
generate a subtle sense of loss, and motivate us to make the purchase even more.
A recent study also revealed the power of touch, in this case when it came to conventional 
mail. A deeper and longer-lasting impression of a message was formed when delivered in a letter, as
opposed to receiving the same message online. Brain imaging showed that, on touching the paper, 
the emotional centre of the brain was activated, thus forming a stronger bond. The study also 
indicated that once touch becomes part of the process, it could translate into a sense of possession. 
This sense of ownership is simply not part of the equation in the online shopping experience.
56. Why do people prefer shopping online according to the author?
A) It is more comfortable and convenient.
B) It saves them a lot of money and time.
C) It offers them a lot more options and bargains.
D) It gives them more time to think about their purchase.
57.Why do more customers return their purchases bought online?
A) They regretted indulging in costly items in the recession.
B) They changed their mind by the time the goods were delivered.
C) They had no chance to touch them when shopping online.
D) They later found the quality of goods below their expectations.
58.What is the purpose of the author’s experiment?
A) To test his hypothesis about online shopping.
B) To find out people’s reaction to his recent book.
C) To find ways to increase the sale of his new book.
6
D) To try different approaches to sales promotion.
59. How might people feel after letting go of something they held?
A) A sense of disappointment.           
C) A subtle loss of interest.
B) More motivated to own it.             
D) Less sensitive to its texture.
60.What does brain imaging in a recent study reveal?
A) Conventional letters contain subtle messages.
B) A lack of touch is the chief obstacle to e-commerce.
C) Email lacks the potential to activate the brain.
D) Physical touch helps form a sense of possession.
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
Apparently everyone knows that global warming only makes climate more extreme. A hot, dry
summer has triggered another flood of such claims. And, while many interests are at work, one of 
the players that benefits the most from this story are the media: the notion of “extreme” climate 
simply makes for more compelling news.
Consider Paul Krugman, writing breathlessly in The New York Times about the “rising 
incidence of extreme events”. He claims that global warming caused the current drought in 
America’s Midwest, and that supposedly record-high corn prices could cause a global food crisis.
But the United Nations climate panel’s latest assessment tells us precisely the opposite: For 
“North America, there is medium confidence that there has been an overall slight tendency towards 
less dryness”. Moreover, there is no way that Krugman could have identified this drought as being 
caused by global warming without a time machine: Climate models estimate that such detection 
will be possible by 2048, at the earliest.
And, fortunately, this year’s drought appears unlikely to cause a food crisis, as global rice and 
wheat supplies remain plentiful. Moreover, Krugman overlooks inflation: Prices have increased, 
six-fold since 1969, so, while corn futures（期货）did set a record of about $8 per bushel（蒲式
耳）in late July, the inflation-adjusted price of corn was higher throughout most of the 1970s, 
reaching $16 in 1974.
Finally, Krugman conveniently forgets that concerns about global warming are the main 
reason that com prices have skyrocketed since 2005. Nowadays 40 percent of com grown in the 
United States is used to produce ethanol (乙醇), which does absolutely nothing for the climate, but 
certainly distorts the price of com — at the expense of many of the worlds poorest people.
Bill McKibben similarly worries in The Guardian about the Midwest drought and com prices. 
He confidently tells us that raging wildfires from New Mexico and Colorado to Siberia are 
“exactly” what the early stages of global warming look like.
In fact, the latest overview of global wildfire incidence suggests that fire intensity has declined
over the past 70 years and is now close to its preindustrial level.
When well-meaning campaigners want us to pay attention to global warming, they often end 
up pitching beyond the facts. And, while this may seem justified by a noble goal, such “policy by 
panic” tactics rarely work, and often backfire.
Remember how, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, A1 Gore claimed that we were in 
store for ever more destructive hurricanes? Since then, hurricane incidence has dropped off the 
charts. Exaggerated claims merely fuel public distrust and disengagement.
That is unfortunate, because global warming is a real problem, and we do need to address it.
61.In what way do the media benefit from extreme weather?
A) They can attract people’s attention to their reports.
B) They can choose from a greater variety of topics.
C) They can make themselves better known.
D) They can give voice to different views.
62.What is the author’s comment on Krugman’s claim about the current drought in America’s 
Midwest?
A) A time machine is needed to testify to its truth.
B) It is based on an erroneous climate model.
7
C) It will eventually get proof in 2048.
D) There is no way to prove its validity.
63.What is the chief reason for the rise in com prices according to the author?
A) Demand for food has been rising in the developing countries.
B) A considerable portion of com is used to produce green fuel.
C) Climate change has caused com yields to drop markedly.
D) Inflation rates have been skyrocketing since the 1970s.
64.What does the author say about global wildfire incidence over the past 70 years?
A) It has got worse with the rise in extreme weathers.
B) It signals the early stages of global warming.
C) It has dropped greatly.
D) It is related to drought.
65. What does the author think of the exaggerated claims in the media about global warming?
A) They are strategies to raise public awareness.
B) They do a disservice to addressing the problem.
C) They aggravate public distrust about science.
D) They create confusion about climate change.

Part Ⅲ                                        Reading Comprehension
Section A
Directions： In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word
far each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage
through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter.
Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through
the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
Children are losing the ability to play properly because they are being given too many toys,
according to a new research. The studies show that children — especially those under five — are
often    36    and actually play less than those with fewer toys.
“Our studies show that giving children too many toys or toys of the   37   type can actually be
doing them harm. They get spoiled and cannot   38   on any one thing long enough to learn from it”,
said Lerner, a childhood development researcher. Her conclusions have been backed up by British
research looking at children with   39   few toys, whose parents spend more time reading, singing or
playing with them. It showed such children   40   youngsters from richer backgrounds — even
those who had access to computers.
Kathy Sylva, professor of educational psychology at Oxford University, reached her   41  from
a study of 3,000 children from the ages of three to five. In her opinion, there is a complex
relationship between children’s progress, the type of toys they are given and the time parents spend
on them. When the children have a large number of toys there seems to be a distraction element,
and when children are    42   
 
 they do not learn or play well.
Some parents notice the   43  
 
     early. Orhan Ismail, a researcher from Colchester, Essex, saw a
change for the worse in Cameron, his 10-month-old son, after he was given   44   toys last
Christmas. He observed that if there are too many toys in front of Cameron, he will just keep
moving round them and then end up going away and finding something like a slipper to play with.
Experts   45   to put a figure on the number of toys children should have, but many believe two
dozen is enough for children of pre-school age.
A) impact                  I) surpass
B) concentrate           J) innumerable
C) overwhelmed       K) decisions
D) reasonably            L) inaccurate
E) conclusions           M) relatively
F) exquisite                N) distracted
G) embarrassed          O) lag
H) hesitate

the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is
marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
Norman Borlaug: “Father of the Green Revolution”
1
[A] Few people have quietly changed the world for the better more than this rural lad from the
midwestem state of Iowa in the United States. The man in focus is Norman Borlaug, the
“Father of the Green Revolution”, who died on 12 September 2009 at age 95. Norman Borlaug
spent most of his 60 working years in the farmlands of Mexico, South Asia and later in Africa,
fighting world hunger, and saving by some estimates up to a billion lives in the process. An
achievement, fit for a Nobel Peace Prize.
Early Years
[B] “I’m a product of the great depression” is how Borlaug described himself. A great-grandson of
Norwegian immigrants to the United States, Borlaug was born in 1914 and grew up on a small
farm in the northeastern comer of Iowa in a town called Cresco. His family had a 40-hectrare
( 公顷 )farm on which they grew wheat, maize (玉米 )and hay and raised pigs and cattle.
Norman spent most of his time from age 7-17 on the farm, even as he attended a one-room,
one-teacher school at New Oregon in Howard County.
[C] Borlaug didn’t have money to go to college. But through a Great Depression era programme,
known as the National Youth Administration, Borlaug was able to enroll in University of
Minnesota at Minneapolis to study forestry. He excelled in studies and received his PhD in
plant pathology (病理学）and genetics in 1942.
[D]  From 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a microbiologist at DuPont in Wilmington.
However, following the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Borlaug tried to join the
military, but was rejected under wartime labour regulations.
In Mexico
[E] In 1944, many experts warned of mass starvation in developing nations where populations were
expanding faster than crop production. Borlaug began work at a Rockefeller Foundation-
funded project in Mexico to increase wheat production by developing higher-yielding varieties
of the crop. It involved research in genetics, plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology（昆
虫学），agronomy（农艺学）,soil science, and cereal technology. The goal of the project
was to boost wheat production in Mexico, which at the time was importing a large portion of
its grain.
[F] Borlaug said that his first couple of years in Mexico were difficult. He lacked trained scientists
and equipment. Native farmers were hostile towards the wheat programme because of serious
crop losses from 1939 to 1941 due to stem rust.
[G] Wheat varieties that Borlaug worked with had tall, thin stalks. While taller wheat competed
better for sunlight, they had a tendency to collapse under the weight of extra grain — a trait
called lodging. To overcome this, Borlaug worked on breeding wheat with shorter and stronger
stalks, which could hold on larger seed heads. Borlaug’s new semi-dwarf, disease-resistant
varieties, called Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62, changed the potential yield of Mexican wheat
dramatically. By 1963 wheat production in Mexico stood six times more than that of 1944.
Green Revolution in India
[H]  During the 1960s, South Asia experienced severe drought condition and India had been
importing wheat on a large scale from the United States. Borlaug came to India in 1963 along
with  Dr  Robert  Anderson  to  duplicate  his  Mexican  success  in  the  sub-continent.  The
experiments began with planting a few of the high-yielding variety strains in the fields of the
Indian Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa in New Delhi, under the supervision of Dr M. S.
Swaminathan. These strains were subsequently planted in test plots at Ludhiana, Pantnagar,
Kanpur, Pune and Indore. The results were promising, but large-scale success, however, was
not instant. Cultural opposition to new agricultural techniques initially prevented Borlaug from
going ahead with planting of new wheat strains in India. By 1965, when the drought situation
turned alarming, the Government took the lead and allowed wheat revolution to move forward.
By employing agricultural techniques he developed in Mexico, Borlaug was able to nearly
double South Asian wheat harvests between 1965 and 1970.
[I] India subsequently made a huge commitment to Mexican wheat, importing some 18,000 tonnes
of seed. By 1968, it was clear that the Indian wheat harvest was nothing short of revolutionary.
It was so productive that there was a shortage of labour to harvest it, of bull carts to haul it to
2
the threshing floor（打谷场）of jute（黄麻）bags to store it. Local governments in some
areas were forced to shut down schools temporarily to use them as store houses.
[J] United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) observed that in 40 years between
1961 and  2001,“India more than doubled its population, from 452 million to more than 1
billion. At the same time, it nearly tripled its grain production from 87 million tonnes to 231
million tonnes. It accomplished this feat while increasing cultivated grain acreage （土地面
积） a mere 8 percent.” It was in India that Norman Borlaug’s work was described as the
“Green Revolution.”
In Africa
[K] Africa suffered widespread hunger and starvation through the 70s and 80s. Food and aid poured
in from most developed countries into the continent, but thanks to the absence of efficient
distribution system, the hungry remained empty-stomach. The then Chairman of the Nippon
Foundation, Ryoichi Sasakawa wondered why the methods used in Mexico and India were not
extended to Africa. He called up Norman Borlaug, now leading a semi-retired life, for help. He
managed to convince Borlaug to help with his new effort and subsequently founded the
Sasakawa Africa Association. Borlaug later recalled, “but after I saw the terrible circumstances
there, I said, ‘Let’s just start growing’”.
[L] The success in Africa was not as spectacular as it was in India or Mexico. Those elements that
allowed Borlaug’s projects to succeed, such as well-organised economies and transportation
and irrigation systems, were severely lacking throughout Africa. Because of this, Borlaug’s
initial projects were restricted to developed regions of the continent. Nevertheless, yields of
maize, sorghum (高粱) and wheat doubled between 1983 and 1985.
Nobel Prize
[M] For his contributions to the world food supply, Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in
1970. Norwegian officials notified his wife in Mexico City at 4:00 am, but Borlaug had
already left for the test fields in the Toluca valley, about 65km west of Mexico City. A
chauffeur ( 司机 ） took her to the fields to inform her husband. In his acceptance speech,
Borlaug said, “the first essential component of social justice is adequate food for all mankind.
Food is the moral right of all who are born into this world. Yet, 50 percent of the world
population goes hungry.”
Green Revolution vs Environmentalists
[N]  Borlaug’s advocacy of intensive high-yield agriculture came under severe criticism from
environmentalists  in  recent  years.  His  work  faced  environmental  and  socio-economic
criticisms, including charges that his methods have created dependence on monoculture crops,
unsustainable fanning practices, heavy indebtedness among subsistence farmers, and high
levels of cancer among those who work with agriculture chemicals. There are also concerns
about the long-term sustainability of fanning practices encouraged by the Green Revolution in
both the developed and the developing world.
[O] In India, the Green Revolution is blamed for the destruction of India crop diversity, drought
vulnerability, dependence on agro-chemicals that poison soils but reap large-scale benefits
mostly  to  the  American  multi-national  corporations.  What  these  critics  overwhelmingly
advocate is a global movement towards “organic” or “sustainable” farming practices that
avoid using chemicals and high technology in favour of natural fertilisers, cultivation and pest-
control porgrammes.
46.Farmers’ rejection of his planting techniques initially prevented Borlaug from achieving large-
scale success in India.
47.In both developed and developing countries there are concerns whether in the long run Borlaug’s
farming practice will be sustainable.
48.Borlaug’s Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62 has short and strong stems and can resist to diseases.
49.Borlaug’s success in Africa was not as spectacular as in India or Mexico because Africa lacked
the necessary supporting facilities.
50.In India, critics attribute the destruction of Indian crop diversity to the Green Revolution.
51.Borlaug emphasised that adequate food for all mankind is essential in ensuring social justice in
3
his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.
52.In recent years Borlaug’s Green Revolution has been attacked by environmentalists.
53.Borlaug’s wheat programme had been stuck in trouble during his first couple of years in Mexico.
54.According to United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation, in 40 years between 1961 and
2001 India’s grain production increased nearly three times.
55.Norman Borlaug won a Nobel Prize for his 60 years work on combating world hunger.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or
unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You
should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a
single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
“Depression” is more than a serious economic downturn. What distinguishes a depression
from a harsh recession is paralysing fear — fear of the unknown so great that it causes consumers,
businesses, and investors to retreat and panic. They save up cash and desperately cut spending.
They  sell  stocks  and  other  assets.  A shattering  loss  of  confidence  inspires  behaviour  that
overwhelms the normal self-correcting mechanisms that usually prevent a recession from becoming
deep and prolonged: a depression.
Comparing 1929 with 2007-09, Christina Romer, the head of President Obama’s Council of
Economic Advisers, finds the initial blow to confidence far greater now than then. True, stock
prices fell a third from September to December 1929, but fewer Americans then owned stocks.
Moreover, home prices barely dropped. From December 1928 to December 1929, total household
wealth declined only 3%. By contrast, the loss in household wealth between December 2007 and
December 2008 was  17%. Both stocks  and homes, more widely held, dropped more. Thus
traumatised (受到创伤），the economy might have gone into a free fall ending in depression.
Indeed, it did go into free fall. Shoppers refrained from buying cars, appliances, and other big-
ticket items. Spending on such “durables” dropped at a 12% annual rate in 2008’s third quarter, a 2
0% rate in the fourth. And businesses shelved investment projects.
That these huge declines didn’t lead to depression mainly reflects, as Romer argues, counter-
measures taken by the government. Private markets for goods, services, labor, and securities do
mostly self-correct, but panic feeds on itself and disarms these stabilising tendencies. In this
situation, only the government can protect the economy as a whole, because most individuals and
companies are involved in the self-defeating behaviour of self-protection.
Government’s failure to perform this role in the early 1930s transformed recession into
depression. Scholars will debate which interventions this time — the Federal Reserve’s support of a
failing credit system, guarantees of bank debt, Obama’s “stimulus” plan and bank “stress test” 一
counted most in preventing a recurrence. Regardless, all these complex measures had the same
psychological purpose: to reassure people that the free fall would stop and, thereby, curb die fear
that would perpetuate( 使持久）a free fall.
All this improved confidence. But the consumer sentiment index remains weak, and all the
rebound has occurred in Americans’ evaluation of future economic conditions, not the present.
Unemployment (9.8%) is abysmal(糟透的）, the recovery’s strength unclear. Here, too, there is an
echo from the 1930s. Despite bottoming out in 1933, the Depression didn’t end until World War II.
Some government policies aided recovery; some hindered it. The good news today is that the bad
news is not worse.
56.Why do consumers, businesses and investors retreat and panic in times of depression?
A) They suffer great losses in stocks, property and other assets.
B) They find the self-correcting mechanisms dysfunctioning.
C) They are afraid the normal social order will be paralysed.
D) They don’t know what is going to happen in the future.
57.What does Christina Romer say about the current economic recession?
A) Its severity is no match for the Great Depression of 1929.
4
B) Its initial blow to confidence far exceeded that of 1929.
C) It has affected house owners more than stock holders.
D) It has resulted in a free fall of the prices of commodities.
58.Why didn’t the current recession turn into a depression according to Christina Romer?
A) The government intervened effectively.
B) Private markets corrected themselves.
C) People refrained from buying durables and big-ticket items.
D) Individuals and companies adopted self-protection measures.
59.What is the chief purpose of all the counter measures taken?
A) To create job opportunities.
C)To stimulate domestic consumption.
B) To curb the fear of a lasting free fall.
D)To rebuild the credit system.
60.What does the author think of today’s economic situation?
A) It may worsen without further stimulation.
C)It has not gone from bad to worse.
B) It will see a rebound sooner or later.             
D)It does not give people reason for pessimism.
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
“Usually when we walk through-the rain forest we hear a soft sound from all the moist leaves
and organic debris on the forest floor,” says ecologist Daniel Nepstad. “ Now we increasingly get
rustle and crunch. That’s the sound of a dying forest.”
Predictions of the collapse of the tropical rain forests have been around for years. Yet until
recently the worst forecasts were almost exclusively linked to direct human activity, such as dear-
cutting and burning for pastures or farms. Left alone, it was assumed, the world’s rain forests would
not only flourish but might even rescue us from disaster by absorbing the excess carbon dioxide
and other planet-warming greenhouse gases. Now it turns out that may be wishful thinking. Some
scientists believe that the rise in carbon levels means that the Amazon and other rain forests in Asia
and Africa may go from being assets in the battle against rising temperatures to liabilities. Amazon
plants, for instance, hold more than 100 billion metric tons of carbon, equal to 15 years of tailpipe
and  chimney  emissions. If  the  collapse  of the  rain  forests  speeds  up  dramatically,  it  could
eventually release 3.5-5 billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year 一 making
forests the leading source of greenhouse gases.
Uncommonly severe droughts brought on by global climate change have led to forest-eating
wildfires from Australia to Indonesia, but nowhere more acutely than in the Amazon. Some experts
say that the rain forest is already at the brink of collapse.
Extreme weather and reckless development are plotting against the rain forest in ways that
scientists have never seen. Trees need more water as temperatures rise, but the prolonged droughts
have robbed them of moisture, making whole forests easily cleared of trees and turned into
farmland. The picture worsens with each round of El Nino, the unusually warm currents in the
Pacific Ocean that drive up temperatures and invariably presage（预示）droughts and fires in the
rain forest. Runaway fires pour even more carbon into the air, which increases temperatures,
starting the whole vicious cycle all over again.
More than paradise lost, a perishing rain forest could trigger a domino effect—sending winds
and rains kilometres off course and loading the skies with even greater levels of greenhouse gases
— that will be felt far beyond the Amazon basin. In a sense, we are already getting a glimpse of
what’s to come. Each burning season in the Amazon, fires deliberately set by frontier settlers and
developers hurl up almost half a billion metric tons of carbon a year, placing Brazil among the top
five contributors to greenhouse gases in the world.
61.We learn from the first paragraph that
.
A) dead leaves and tree debris make the same sound
B) trees that are dying usually give out a soft moan
C) organic debris echoes the sounds in a rain forest
D) the sound of a forest signifies its health condition
62.In the second paragraph, the author challenges the view that
.
A) the collapse of rain forests is caused by direct human interference
5
B) carbon emissions are the leading cause of current global warming
C) the condition of rain forests has been rapidly deteriorating
D) rain forests should not be converted into pastures or farms
63.The author argues that the rising carbon levels in rain forests may
.
A) turn them into a major source of greenhouse gases
B) change the weather patterns throughout the world
C) pose a threat to wildlife
D) accelerate their collapse
64.What has made it easier to turn some rain forests into farmland?
A)  Rapid rise in carbon levels.
C)  Lack  of  rainfall  resulting  from  global
warming.
B)  Reckless land development.                       D) The unusual warm currents in the Pacific Ocean.
65.What makes Brazil one of the world’s top five contributors to greenhouse gases?
A) The domino effect triggered by the perishing rain forests.
B) Its practice of burning forests for settlement and development.
C) The changed patterns of winds and rains in the Amazon area.
D) Its inability to curb the carbon emissions from industries.

      in our self-image are the categories in which you place yourself, the roles you play, and other   
27  
 
   scriptors you use to identify yourself. If you tell an   28   you are a grandfather who recently 
lost his wife and who does   29 
 
     work on weekends, several elements of your self-image are 
brought to light —the roles of grandparent, widower, and   30
 
       citizen.
But self-image is more than how you picture yourself; it also involves how others see you. 
Three types of feedback from others      31
         how they see us: confirmation, rejection, and 
disconfirmation. Confirmation occurs when others treat you in a manner consistent with who you 
believe you are. You believe you have leadership abilities and your boss put you in charge of a new 
work team. On the other hand, rejection occurs when others treat you in a manner that    32   your 
self-definition. Pierre Salinger was appointed senator from California but    33  lost his first 
election. He thought he was a good public official, but the voters obviously thought otherwise —
their vote was inconsistent with his   34  . The third type of feedback is disconfirmation, which 
occurs when others fail to respond to your notion of self by responding neutrally. A student writes 
what he thinks is an excellent composition, but the teacher writes no encouraging remarks. Rather 
than   35   how others classify you, consider how you identify yourself. The way in which you 
identify yourself is the best reflection of your self-image.
Part Ⅲ                                        Reading Comprehension
Section A
Directions： In this section, there is a passage with ten blanks. You are required to select one word
far each blank from a list of choices given in a word bank following the passage. Read the passage 
through carefully before making your choices. Each choice in the bank is identified by a letter. 
Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through 
the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.
Questions 36 to 45 are based on the following passage.
Proper street behaviour in the United States requires a nice balance of attention and 
inattention. You are supposed to look at a passerby just enough to show that you are aware of his   
36   If you look too little, you appear haughty(目中无人的), too much and you are inquisitive（过
分好奇地）.Usually what happens is that people eye each other until they are about eight feet 
apart, at which point both cast down their eyes. Sociologist Erving Goffman describes this as “a 
kind of    37   of lights”.
Much of eye behaviour is so    38    that we react to it only on the intuitive level. The next time
you have a conversation with someone who makes you feel liked, notice what he does with his 
eyes. Chances are he looks at you more often than is usual with    39    a little longer than the 
normal. You    40   this as a sign — a polite one —  that he is interested in you as a person rather 
than just in the topic of conversation. Probably you also feel that he is both self-confident and 
sincere. 
All this has been demonstrated in    41   experiments. Subjects sit and talk in the psychologist’s
laboratory,   42   of the fact that their eye behaviour is being observed from a one way vision 
screen. In one fairly typical experiment, subjects were  43  to cheat while performing a task, then 
were interviewed and observed. It was found that those who had cheated met the interviewer’s eyes
less often than was    44    , an indication that “shifty eyes” —  to use the mystery writers’ stock 
phrase — can    45    be a tip-off(表明）to an attempt to deceive or to feelings of guilt.
A) innocent               I) actually
B) interpret               J) subtle
C) sights                   K) induced
D) dimming              L) hiding
E) normal                 M) presence
F) deceived               N) doubtfully
G) glances                 O) elaborate
H) obscure
Section B
Directions: In this section, you are going to read a passage with ten statements attached to it. Each
statement contains information given in one of the paragraphs. Identify the paragraph from which 
the information is derived. You may choose a paragraph more than once. Each paragraph is 
marked with a letter. Answer the questions by marking the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2.
A Nation That’s Losing Its Toolbox
[A] The scene inside the Home Depot on Weyman Avenue here would give the old-time American 
craftsman pause. In Aisle 34 is precut plastic flooring, the glue already in place. In Aisle 26 are
prefabricated windows. Stacked near the checkout counters, and as colourful as a Fisher-Price 
toy, is a not-so-serious-looking power tool: a battery-operated saw-and-drill combination. And 
if you don’t want to do it yourself, head to Aisle 23 or Aisle 35, where a help desk will arrange
for an installer.
[B] It’s all very handy stuff, I guess, a convenient way to be a do-it-yourselfer without being all that
good with tools. But at a time when the American factory seems to be a shrinking presence, 
and when good manufacturing jobs have vanished, perhaps never to return, there is something 
deeply troubling about this dilution of American craftsmanship.
[C] This isn’t a lament(伤感) — or not merely a lament — for bygone times. It’s a social and 
cultural issue, as well as an economic one. The Home Depot approach to craftsmanship — 
simplify it, dumb it down, hire a contractor— is one signal that mastering tools and working 
with one’s hands is receding in America as a hobby, as a valued skill, as a cultural influence 
that shaped thinking and behaviour in vast sections of the country. 
[D] That should be a matter of concern in a presidential election year. Yet neither Barack Obama 
nor Mitt Romney promotes himself as tool-savvy(使用工具很在行的）presidential timber, in
the mold of a Jimmy Carter, a skilled carpenter and cabinet maker. The Obama administration 
does worry publicly about manufacturing, a first cousin of craftsmanship. When the Ford 
Motor Company, for example, recently announced that it was bringing some production home,
the White House cheered. “When you see things like Ford moving new production from 
Mexico to Detroit, instead of the other way around, you know things are changing,” says Gene
Sperling, director of the National Economic Council.
[E] Ask the administration or the Republicans or most academics why America needs more 
manufacturing, and they respond that manufacturing gives birth to innovation, brings down the
trade deficit, strengthens the dollar, generates jobs, arms the military and brings about a 
recovery from recession. But rarely, if ever, do they publicly take the argument a step further, 
asserting that a growing manufacturing sector encourages craftsmanship and that 
craftsmanship is, if not a birthright, then a vital ingredient of the American self-image as a 
can-do, inventive, we-can-make-anything people.
[F] Traditional vocational training in public high schools is gradually declining, stranding 
thousands
of young people who seek training for a craft without going to college. Colleges, for their part,
have since 1985 graduated fewer chemical, mechanical, industrial and metallurgical(冶金
的）engineers, partly in response to the reduced role of manufacturing, a big employer of 
them. The decline started in the 1950s, when manufacturing generated a sturdy 28% of the 
national income, or gross domestic product, and employed one-third of the workforce. Today, 
factory output generates just 12% of GDP and employs barely 9% of the nation’s workers.
[G] Mass layoffs and plant closings have drawn plenty of headlines and public debate over the 
years, and they still occasionally do. But the damage to skill and craftsmanship — what’s 
needed to build a complex airliner or a tractor, or for a worker to move up from assembler to 
machinist to supervisor — went largely unnoticed.
[H] “In an earlier generation, we lost our connection to the land, and now we are losing our 
connection to the machinery we depend on,” says Michael Hout, a sociologist at the 
University of California, Berkeley. “People who work with their hands,” he went on, “are 
doing things today that we call service jobs, in restaurants and laundries, or in medical 
technology and the like.”
[I] That’s one explanation for the decline in traditional craftsmanship. Lack of interest is another.

The big money is in fields like finance. Starting in the 1980s, skill in finance grew in 
importance, and, as depicted in the news media and the movies, became a more appealing 
source of income. By last year, Wall Street traders, bankers and those who deal in real estate 
generated 21% of the national income, double their share in the 1950s. And Warren Buffett, 
the good-natured financier, became a homespun folk hero, without the tools and overalls (工
作服).
[J] “Young people grow up without developing the skills to fix things around the house,” says 
Richard Curtin, director of the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of 
Consumers. “They know about computers, of course, but they don’t know how to build them.”
[K] Manufacturing’s shrinking presence undoubtedly helps explain the decline in craftsmanship, if 
only because many of the nation’s assembly line workers were skilled in craft work, if not on 
the job then in their spare time. In a late 1990s study of blue-collar employees at a General 
Motors plant (now closed) in Linden, NJ, the sociologist Ruth Milkman of City University of 
New York found that many line workers, in their off-hours, did home renovation and other 
skilled work. “I have often thought,” Ms Milkman says, “that these extracurricular jobs were 
an effort on the part of the workers to regain their dignity after suffering the degradation of 
repetitive assembly line work in the factory.”
[L] Craft work has higher status in nations like Germany, which invests in apprenticeship（学
徒）programmes for high school students. “Corporations in Germany realised that there was 
an interest to be served economically and patriotically in building up a skilled labour force at 
home; we never had that ethos（风气）,”says Richard Sennett, a New York University 
sociologist who has written about the connection of craft and culture.
[M] The damage to American craftsmanship seems to parallel the steep slide in manufacturing 
employment. Though the decline started in the 1970s, it became much steeper beginning in 
2000. Since then, some 5.3 million jobs, or one-third of the workforce in manufacturing, have 
been lost. A stated goal of the Obama administration is to restore a big chunk of this 
employment, along with the multitude of skills that many of the jobs required.
[N] As for craftsmanship itself, the issue is how to preserve it as a valued skill in the general 
population. Ms Milkman, the sociologist, argues that American craftsmanship isn’t 
disappearing as quickly as some would argue — that it has instead shifted to immigrants. 
“Pride in craft, it is alive in the immigrant world,” she says.
[O] Sol Axelrod, 37, the manager of the Home Depot here, fittingly learned to fix his own car as a 
teenager, even changing the brakes. Now he finds immigrant craftsmen. gathered in abundance
outside his store in the early morning, waiting for it to open so they can buy supplies for the 
day’s work as contractors. Skilled day laborers, also mostly immigrants, wait quietly in hopes 
of being hired by the contractors. Mr Axelrod also says the recession and persistently high 
unemployment have forced many people to try to save money by doing more themselves, and 
Home Depot in response offers classes in fixing water taps and other simple repairs. The 
teachers are store employees, many of them older and semi-retired from a skilled trade, or laid 
off. “Our customers may not be building cabinets or outdoor decks; we try to do that for 
them,’’ Mr Axelrod says, “but some are trying to build up skill so they can do more for 
themselves in these hard times.”
46.Mastering tools and working with one’s hands shapes people’s thinking and behaviour.
47.The factor that people can earn more money in fields other than manufacturing contributes to the
decline in traditional craftsmanship.
48.According to the author, manufacturing encourages craftsmanship.
49.According to Ruth Milkman, American craftsmanship, instead of disappearing, is being taken up
by immigrants.
50.The White House welcomed Ford’s announcement to bring some production back to America.
51.According to Mr Axelrod of Home Depot, people are trying to ride out the recession by doing 
more themselves.
52.America’s manufacturing in the 1950s constituted 28% of the gross domestic product.
53.In Ruth Milkman’s opinion, many assembly line workers did home renovation and other skilled 
work in their off-hours in order to regain their dignity.
54.The author felt troubled about the weakening of American craftsmanship.
55.Compared with that in America, the status of craft work in Germany is higher.
Section C
Directions: There are 2 passages in this section. Each passage is followed by some questions or 
unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A), B), C) and D). You 
should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 2 with a 
single line through the centre.
Passage One
Questions 56 to 60 are based on the following passage.
The report from the Bureau of Labour Statistics was just as gloomy as anticipated. 
Unemployment in January jumped to a 16-year high of 7.6 percent, as 598,000 jobs were slashed 
from U.S. payrolls in the worst single-month decline since December, 1974. With 1.8 million jobs 
lost in the last three months, there is urgent desire to boost the economy as quickly as possible. But 
Washington would do well to take a deep breath before reacting to the grim numbers.
Collectively, we rely on the unemployment figures and other statistics to frame our sense of 
reality. They are a vital part of an array of data that we use to assess if we’re doing well or doing 
badly, and that in turn shapes government policies and corporate budgets and personal spending 
decisions. The problem is that the statistics aren’t an objective measure of reality; they are simply a 
best approximation. Directionally, they capture the trends, but the idea that we know precisely how 
many are unemployed is a myth. That makes finding a solution all the more difficult.
First, there is the way the data is assembled. The official unemployment rate is the product of a
telephone survey of about 60,000 homes. There is another survey, sometimes referred to as the 
“payroll survey”, that assesses 400,000 businesses based on their reported payrolls. Both surveys 
have problems. The payroll survey can easily double-count someone: if you are one person with 
two jobs, you show up as two workers. The payroll survey also doesn’t capture the number of self- 
employed, and so says little about how many people are generating an independent income.
The household survey has a larger problem. When asked straightforwardly, people tend to lie 
or shade the truth when the subject is sex, money or employment. If you get a call and are asked if 
you’re employed, and you say yes, you’re employed. If you say no, however, it may surprise you to
learn that you are only unemployed if you’ve been actively looking for work in the past four weeks;
otherwise, you are “marginally attached to the labour force” and not actually unemployed.
The urge to quantify is embedded in our society. But the idea that statisticians can then capture
an objective reality isn’t just impossible. It also leads to serious misjudgments. Democrats and 
Republicans can and will take sides on a number of issues, but a more crucial concern is that both 
are basing major policy decisions on guesstimates rather than looking at the vast wealth of raw data
with a critical eye and an open mind.
56.What do we learn from the first paragraph?
A) The US economic situation is going from bad to worse.
B) Washington is taking drastic measures to provide more jobs.
C) The US government is slashing more jobs from its payrolls.
D) The recent economic crisis has taken the US by surprise.
57.What does the author think of the unemployment figures and other statistics?
A) They form a solid basis for policy making.
C) They signal future economic trends.
B) They represent the current situation.
D) They do not fully reflect the reality.
58.  One problem with the payroll survey is that
           .
A)  it does not include all the businesses
C) it magnifies the number of the jobless
B)  it fails to count in the self-employed
D) it does not treat all companies equally
59.  The household survey can be faulty in that
.
A) people tend to lie when talking on the phone
B) not everybody is willing or ready to respond
C) some people won’t provide truthful information
D) the definition of unemployment is too broad
6
60.  At the end of the passage, the author suggests that .
A) statisticians improve their data assembling methods
B) decision makers view the statistics with a critical eye
C) politicians listen more before making policy decisions
D) Democrats and Republicans cooperate on crucial issues
Passage Two
Questions 61 to 65 are based on the following passage.
At some point in 2008, someone, probably in either Asia or Africa, made the decision to move 
from the countryside to the city. This nameless person pushed the human race over a historic 
threshold, for it was in that year that mankind became, for the first time in its history, a 
predominantly urban species.
It is a trend that shows no sign of slowing. Demographers(人 口统计学家）reckon that 
three-quarters of humanity could be city-dwelling by 2050, with most of the increase coming in the 
fast-growing towns of Asia and Africa. Migrants to cities are attracted by plentiful jobs, access to 
hospitals and education, and the ability to escape the boredom of a farmer’s agricultural life. Those 
factors are more than enough to make up for the squalor（肮脏 ）disease and spectacular poverty 
that those same migrants must often at first endure when they become urban dwellers.
It is the city that inspires the latest book from Peter Smith. His main thesis is that the buzz of 
urban life, and the opportunities it offers for cooperation and collaboration, is what attracts people 
to the city, which in turn makes cities into the engines of art, commerce, science and progress. This 
is hardly revolutionary, but it is presented in a charming format. Mr Smith has written a breezy 
guidebook, with a series of short chapters dedicated to specific aspects of urbanity — parks, say, or 
the various schemes that have been put forward over the years for building the perfect city. The 
result is a sort of high-quality, unusually rigorous coffee-table book, designed to be dipped into 
rather than read from beginning to end.
In the chapter on skyscrapers, for example, Mr Smith touches on construction methods, the 
revolutionary invention of the automatic lift, the practicalities of living in the sky and the likelihood
that, as cities become more crowded, apartment living will become the norm. But there is also time 
for brief diversions onto bizarre ground, such as a discussion of the skyscraper index (which holds 
that a boom in skyscraper construction is a foolproof sign of an imminent recession).
One obvious criticism is that the price of breadth is depth: many of Mr Smith’s essays raise as 
many questions as they answer. Although that can indeed be frustrating, this is probably the only 
way to treat so grand a topic. The city is the building block of civilisation and of almost everything 
people do; a guidebook to the city is really, therefore, a guidebook to how a large and ever-growing 
chunk of humanity chooses to live. Mr Smiths book serves as an excellent introduction to a vast 
subject, and will suggest plenty of further lines of inquiry.
61.  In what way is the year 2008 historic?
A) For the first time in history, urban people outnumbered rural people.
B) An influential figure decided to move from the countryside to the city.
C) It is in this year that urbanisation made a start in Asia and Africa.
D) The population increase in cities reached a new peak in Asia and Africa.
62. What does the author say about urbanisation?
A) Its impact is not easy to predict.
C) It is a milestone in human progress.
B) Its process will not slow down.
D) It aggravates the squalor of cities.
63. How does the author comment on Peter Smith’s new book?
A) It is but an ordinary coffee-table book.
C) It serves as a guide to art and commerce.
B) It is flavoured with humorous stories.               D) It is written in a lively and interesting style.
64. What does the author say in the chapter on skyscrapers?
A) The automatic lift is indispensable in skyscrapers.
B) People enjoy living in skyscrapers with a view.
C) Skyscrapers are a sure sign of a city’s prosperity.
D) Recession closely follows a skyscraper boom.
65. What may be one criticism of Mr Smith’s book?
A) It does not really touch on anything serious.
B) It is too long for people to read from cover to cover.
C) It does not deal with any aspect of city life in depth.
D) It fails to provide sound advice to city dwellers.
