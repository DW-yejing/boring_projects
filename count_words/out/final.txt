that hasn t found americans getting less sleep than they ought to says dr david the beginning of our sleep deficit crisis can be to the invention of the light bulb a century ago from diary entries and other personal accounts from the th and th centuries sleep scientists have reached the that the average person used to sleep about hours a night by the s and s that sleep schedule had been reduced to between and hours and most people had to wake to an alarm clock people cheat on their sleep and they don t realise they re doing it says dr david they think they re okay because they can get by on hours when they really need or even more to feel vigorous perhaps the most merciless robber of sleep researchers say is the of the day whenever pressures from work family friends and community mount many people consider sleep the least expensive item on the agenda in our society you re considered if you say you only need hours sleep if you say you ve got to get hours people think you lack drive and ambition to assess the of sleep deficit researchers have put subjects through a set of psychological and performance tests requiring them for instance to add columns of numbers or a passage read

that many professors may view as a bit counterproductive some colleges and universities are doling out apple iphones and internet capable ipods to their students the always on internet devices raise some novel possibilities like tracking where students gather together with far less controversy colleges could send messages about cancelled classes delayed buses campus crises or just the cafeteria menu b while schools emphasise its usefulness online research in class and instant polling of students for example a big part of the attraction is undoubtedly that the iphone is cool and a hit with students being equipped with one of the most recent cutting edge it products could just help a college or university foster a cutting edge reputation c apple stands to win as well hooking more young consumers with decades of technology purchases ahead of them the lone losers some fear could be professors students already have laptops and cell phones of course but the newest devices can take class distractions to a new level they practically beg a user to ignore the long suffering professor struggling to pass on accumulated wisdom from the front of the room a prospect that teachers find most irritating and students view as well inevitable d when it gets a little boring i might pull it out acknowledged naomi pugh a first year student at freed hardeman university in henderson tenn referring to her new ipod touch which can connect to the internet over a campus wireless network she speculated that professors might try even harder to make classes interesting if they were to compete with the devices e experts see a movement toward the use of mobile technology in education though they say it is in its infancy as professors try to come up with useful applications providing powerful hand held devices is sure to fuel debates over the role of technology in higher education we think this is the way the future is going to work said kyle dickson co director of research and the mobile learning initiative at abilene christian university in texas which has bought more than iphones and ipods for students entering this fall f although plenty of students take their laptops to class they don t take them everywhere and would prefer something lighter abilene christian settled on the devices after surveying students and finding that they did not like hauling around their laptops but that most of them always carried a cell phone dr dickson said g it is not clear how many colleges and universities plan to give out iphones and ipods this fall officials at apple were unwilling to talk about the subject and said that they would not leak any institution s plans we can t announce other people s news said greg joswiak vice president of ipod and iphone marketing at apple he also said that he could not discuss discounts to universities for bulk purchases h at least four institutions the university of maryland oklahoma christian university abilene christian and freed hardeman have announced that they will give the devices to some or all of their students this fall other universities are exploring their options stanford university has hired a student run company to design applications like a campus map and directory for the iphone it is considering whether to issue iphones but not sure it s necessary noting that more than iphones were registered on the university s network last year at the massachusetts institute of technology iphones might already have been everywhere if at t the wireless carrier offering the iphone in the united states had a more reliable network said andrew yu mobile devices platform project manager at mit we would have probably gone ahead with this maybe just getting a thousand iphones and giving them out mr yu said i the university of maryland at college park is proceeding cautiously giving the iphone or ipod touch to students said jeffrey huskamp vice president and chief information officer at the university we don t think that we have all the answers mr huskamp said by observing how students use the gadgets he said we re trying to get answers from the students j at each college the students who choose to get an iphone must pay for mobile phone service those service contracts include unlimited data use both the iphones and the ipod touch devices can connect to the internet through campus wireless networks with the iphone those networks may provide faster connections and longer battery life than at t s data network many cell phones allow users to surf the web but only some newer ones are capable of wireless connection to the local area computer network k university officials say that they have no plans to track their students and apple said it would not be possible unless students give their permission they say that they are drawn to the prospect of learning applications outside the classroom though such lesson plans have yet to surface l my colleagues and i are studying something called augmented reality a field of computer research dealing with the combination of real world and virtual reality said christopher dede professor in learning technologies at harvard university alien contact for example is an exercise developed for middle school students who use hand held devices that can determine their location as they walk around a playground or other area text video or audio pops up at various points to help them try to figure out why aliens were in the schoolyard m you can imagine similar kinds of interactive activities along historical lines like following the freedom trail in boston professor dede said it s important that we do research so that we know how well something like this works n the rush to distribute the devices worries some professors who say that students are less likely to participate in class if they are multi tasking i m not someone who s anti technology but i m always worried that technology becomes an end in and of itself and it replaces teaching or it replaces analysis said ellen millender associate professor of classics at reed college in portland ore she added that she hoped to buy an iphone for herself once prices fall robert summers who has taught at cornell law school for about years announced this week in a detailed footnoted memorandum that he would ban laptop computers from his class on contract law i would ban that too if i knew the students were using it in class professor summers said of the iphone after the device and its capabilities were explained to him what we want to encourage in these students is an active intellectual experience in which they develop the wide range of complex reasoning abilities required of good lawyers o the experience at duke university may ease some concerns a few years ago duke began giving ipods to students with the idea that they might use them to record lectures these older models could not access the internet we had assumed that the biggest focus of these devices would be consuming the content said tracy futhey vice president for information technology and chief information officer at duke but that is not all that the students did they began using the ipods to create their own content making audio recordings of themselves and presenting them the students turned what could have been a passive interaction into an active one ms futhey said university officials claim that they dole out iphones and ipods so as to facilitate students learning outside of class in the author s view being equipped with it products may help colleges and universities build an innovative image professor robert summers at cornell law school banned laptop computers from his class because he thinks qualified lawyers need to possess a broad array of complex reasoning abilities naomi pugh at freed hardeman university speculated that professors would have to work harder to enliven their classes the university of maryland at college park is proceeding with caution concerning the use of iphones and ipods many professors think that giving out apple iphones or internet capable ipods to students may not benefit education as intended the experience at duke university may ease some concerns because the students have used ipods for active interaction ellen millender at reed college in portland is concerned that technology will take the place of teaching or analysis the distribution of iphones among students has raised concerns that they will further distract students from class participation experts like dr kyle dickson at abilene christian university think that mobile technology will be more widely used in education section c directions there are passages in this section each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements for each of them there are four choices marked a b c and d you should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on answer sheet with a single line through the centre passage one questions to are based on the following passage in many shoppers chose to avoid the frantic crowds and do their holiday shopping from the comfort of their computer sales at online retailers gained by more than making it the biggest season ever but people are also returning those purchases at record rates up from last year what went wrong is the lingering shadow of the global financial crisis making it harder to accept extravagant indulgences or that people shop more impulsively and therefore make bad decisions when online both arguments are plausible however there is a third factor a question of touch we can love the look but in an online environment we cannot feel the quality of a texture the shape of the fit the fall of a fold or for that matter the weight of an earring and physically interacting with an object makes you more committed to your purchase when my most recent book brandwashed was released i teamed up with a local bookstore to conduct an experiment about the differences between the online and offline shopping experience i carefully instructed a group of volunteers to promote my book in two different ways the first was a fairly hands off approach whenever a customer would inquire about my book the volunteer would take him over to the shelf and point to it out of such requests six customers proceeded with the purchase the second option also involved going over to the shelf but this time removing the book and then subtly holding onto it for just an extra moment before placing it in the customer s hands of the people who were handed the book ended up buying it just physically passing the book showed a big difference in sales why we feel something similar to a sense of ownership when we hold things in our hand that s why we establish or reestablish connection by greeting strangers and friends with a handshake in this case having to then let go of the book after holding it might generate a subtle sense of loss and motivate us to make the purchase even more a recent study also revealed the power of touch in this case when it came to conventional mail a deeper and longer lasting impression of a message was formed when delivered in a letter as opposed to receiving the same message online brain imaging showed that on touching the paper the emotional centre of the brain was activated thus forming a stronger bond the study also indicated that once touch becomes part of the process it could translate into a sense of possession this sense of ownership is simply not part of the equation in the online shopping experience why do people prefer shopping online according to the author a it is more comfortable and convenient b it saves them a lot of money and time c it offers them a lot more options and bargains d it gives them more time to think about their purchase why do more customers return their purchases bought online a they regretted indulging in costly items in the recession b they changed their mind by the time the goods were delivered c they had no chance to touch them when shopping online d they later found the quality of goods below their expectations what is the purpose of the author s experiment a to test his hypothesis about online shopping b to find out people s reaction to his recent book c to find ways to increase the sale of his new book d to try different approaches to sales promotion how might people feel after letting go of something they held a a sense of disappointment c a subtle loss of interest b more motivated to own it d less sensitive to its texture what does brain imaging in a recent study reveal a conventional letters contain subtle messages b a lack of touch is the chief obstacle to e commerce c email lacks the potential to activate the brain d physical touch helps form a sense of possession passage two questions to are based on the following passage apparently everyone knows that global warming only makes climate more extreme a hot dry summer has triggered another flood of such claims and while many interests are at work one of the players that benefits the most from this story are the media the notion of extreme climate simply makes for more compelling news consider paul krugman writing breathlessly in the new york times about the rising incidence of extreme events he claims that global warming caused the current drought in america s midwest and that supposedly record high corn prices could cause a global food crisis but the united nations climate panel s latest assessment tells us precisely the opposite for north america there is medium confidence that there has been an overall slight tendency towards less dryness moreover there is no way that krugman could have identified this drought as being caused by global warming without a time machine climate models estimate that such detection will be possible by at the earliest and fortunately this year s drought appears unlikely to cause a food crisis as global rice and wheat supplies remain plentiful moreover krugman overlooks inflation prices have increased six fold since so while corn futures did set a record of about per bushel in late july the inflation adjusted price of corn was higher throughout most of the s reaching in finally krugman conveniently forgets that concerns about global warming are the main reason that com prices have skyrocketed since nowadays percent of com grown in the united states is used to produce ethanol which does absolutely nothing for the climate but certainly distorts the price of com at the expense of many of the worlds poorest people bill mckibben similarly worries in the guardian about the midwest drought and com prices he confidently tells us that raging wildfires from new mexico and colorado to siberia are exactly what the early stages of global warming look like in fact the latest overview of global wildfire incidence suggests that fire intensity has declined over the past years and is now close to its preindustrial level when well meaning campaigners want us to pay attention to global warming they often end up pitching beyond the facts and while this may seem justified by a noble goal such policy by panic tactics rarely work and often backfire remember how in the wake of hurricane katrina in a gore claimed that we were in store for ever more destructive hurricanes since then hurricane incidence has dropped off the charts exaggerated claims merely fuel public distrust and disengagement that is unfortunate because global warming is a real problem and we do need to address it in what way do the media benefit from extreme weather a they can attract people s attention to their reports b they can choose from a greater variety of topics c they can make themselves better known d they can give voice to different views what is the author s comment on krugman s claim about the current drought in america s midwest a a time machine is needed to testify to its truth b it is based on an erroneous climate model c it will eventually get proof in d there is no way to prove its validity what is the chief reason for the rise in com prices according to the author a demand for food has been rising in the developing countries b a considerable portion of com is used to produce green fuel c climate change has caused com yields to drop markedly d inflation rates have been skyrocketing since the s what does the author say about global wildfire incidence over the past years a it has got worse with the rise in extreme weathers b it signals the early stages of global warming c it has dropped greatly d it is related to drought what does the author think of the exaggerated claims in the media about global warming a they are strategies to raise public awareness b they do a disservice to addressing the problem c they aggravate public distrust about science d they create confusion about climate change part iv translation directions for this part you are allowed minutes to translate a passage from

to play properly because they are being given too many toys according to a new research the studies show that children especially those under five are often and actually play less than those with fewer toys our studies show that giving children too many toys or toys of the type can actually be doing them harm they get spoiled and cannot on any one thing long enough to learn from it said lerner a childhood development researcher her conclusions have been backed up by british research looking at children with few toys whose parents spend more time reading singing or playing with them it showed such children youngsters from richer backgrounds even those who had access to computers kathy sylva professor of educational psychology at oxford university reached her from a study of children from the ages of three to five in her opinion there is a complex relationship between children s progress the type of toys they are given and the time parents spend on them when the children have a large number of toys there seems to be a distraction element and when children are they do not learn or play well some parents notice the early orhan ismail a researcher from colchester essex saw a

of the green revolution a few people have quietly changed the world for the better more than this rural lad from the midwestem state of iowa in the united states the man in focus is norman borlaug the father of the green revolution who died on september at age norman borlaug spent most of his working years in the farmlands of mexico south asia and later in africa fighting world hunger and saving by some estimates up to a billion lives in the process an achievement fit for a nobel peace prize early years b i m a product of the great depression is how borlaug described himself a great grandson of norwegian immigrants to the united states borlaug was born in and grew up on a small farm in the northeastern comer of iowa in a town called cresco his family had a hectrare farm on which they grew wheat maize and hay and raised pigs and cattle norman spent most of his time from age on the farm even as he attended a one room one teacher school at new oregon in howard county c borlaug didn t have money to go to college but through a great depression era programme known as the national youth administration borlaug was able to enroll in university of minnesota at minneapolis to study forestry he excelled in studies and received his phd in plant pathology and genetics in d from to borlaug was employed as a microbiologist at dupont in wilmington however following the december attack on pearl harbor borlaug tried to join the military but was rejected under wartime labour regulations in mexico e in many experts warned of mass starvation in developing nations where populations were expanding faster than crop production borlaug began work at a rockefeller foundation funded project in mexico to increase wheat production by developing higher yielding varieties of the crop it involved research in genetics plant breeding plant pathology entomology agronomy soil science and cereal technology the goal of the project was to boost wheat production in mexico which at the time was importing a large portion of its grain f borlaug said that his first couple of years in mexico were difficult he lacked trained scientists and equipment native farmers were hostile towards the wheat programme because of serious crop losses from to due to stem rust g wheat varieties that borlaug worked with had tall thin stalks while taller wheat competed better for sunlight they had a tendency to collapse under the weight of extra grain a trait called lodging to overcome this borlaug worked on breeding wheat with shorter and stronger stalks which could hold on larger seed heads borlaug s new semi dwarf disease resistant varieties called pitic and penjamo changed the potential yield of mexican wheat dramatically by wheat production in mexico stood six times more than that of green revolution in india h during the s south asia experienced severe drought condition and india had been importing wheat on a large scale from the united states borlaug came to india in along with dr robert anderson to duplicate his mexican success in the sub continent the experiments began with planting a few of the high yielding variety strains in the fields of the indian agricultural research institute at pusa in new delhi under the supervision of dr m s swaminathan these strains were subsequently planted in test plots at ludhiana pantnagar kanpur pune and indore the results were promising but large scale success however was not instant cultural opposition to new agricultural techniques initially prevented borlaug from going ahead with planting of new wheat strains in india by when the drought situation turned alarming the government took the lead and allowed wheat revolution to move forward by employing agricultural techniques he developed in mexico borlaug was able to nearly double south asian wheat harvests between and i india subsequently made a huge commitment to mexican wheat importing some tonnes of seed by it was clear that the indian wheat harvest was nothing short of revolutionary it was so productive that there was a shortage of labour to harvest it of bull carts to haul it to the threshing floor of jute bags to store it local governments in some areas were forced to shut down schools temporarily to use them as store houses j united nation s food and agriculture organisation fao observed that in years between and india more than doubled its population from million to more than billion at the same time it nearly tripled its grain production from million tonnes to million tonnes it accomplished this feat while increasing cultivated grain acreage a mere percent it was in india that norman borlaug s work was described as the green revolution in africa k africa suffered widespread hunger and starvation through the s and s food and aid poured in from most developed countries into the continent but thanks to the absence of efficient distribution system the hungry remained empty stomach the then chairman of the nippon foundation ryoichi sasakawa wondered why the methods used in mexico and india were not extended to africa he called up norman borlaug now leading a semi retired life for help he managed to convince borlaug to help with his new effort and subsequently founded the sasakawa africa association borlaug later recalled but after i saw the terrible circumstances there i said let s just start growing l the success in africa was not as spectacular as it was in india or mexico those elements that allowed borlaug s projects to succeed such as well organised economies and transportation and irrigation systems were severely lacking throughout africa because of this borlaug s initial projects were restricted to developed regions of the continent nevertheless yields of maize sorghum and wheat doubled between and nobel prize m for his contributions to the world food supply borlaug was awarded the nobel peace prize in norwegian officials notified his wife in mexico city at am but borlaug had already left for the test fields in the toluca valley about km west of mexico city a chauffeur took her to the fields to inform her husband in his acceptance speech borlaug said the first essential component of social justice is adequate food for all mankind food is the moral right of all who are born into this world yet percent of the world population goes hungry green revolution vs environmentalists n borlaug s advocacy of intensive high yield agriculture came under severe criticism from environmentalists in recent years his work faced environmental and socio economic criticisms including charges that his methods have created dependence on monoculture crops unsustainable fanning practices heavy indebtedness among subsistence farmers and high levels of cancer among those who work with agriculture chemicals there are also concerns about the long term sustainability of fanning practices encouraged by the green revolution in both the developed and the developing world o in india the green revolution is blamed for the destruction of india crop diversity drought vulnerability dependence on agro chemicals that poison soils but reap large scale benefits mostly to the american multi national corporations what these critics overwhelmingly advocate is a global movement towards organic or sustainable farming practices that avoid using chemicals and high technology in favour of natural fertilisers cultivation and pest control porgrammes farmers rejection of his planting techniques initially prevented borlaug from achieving large scale success in india in both developed and developing countries there are concerns whether in the long run borlaug s farming practice will be sustainable borlaug s pitic and penjamo has short and strong stems and can resist to diseases borlaug s success in africa was not as spectacular as in india or mexico because africa lacked the necessary supporting facilities in india critics attribute the destruction of indian crop diversity to the green revolution borlaug emphasised that adequate food for all mankind is essential in ensuring social justice in his nobel prize acceptance speech in recent years borlaug s green revolution has been attacked by environmentalists borlaug s wheat programme had been stuck in trouble during his first couple of years in mexico according to united nation s food and agriculture organisation in years between and india s grain production increased nearly three times norman borlaug won a nobel prize for his years work on combating world hunger section c directions there are passages in this section each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements for each of them there are four choices marked a b c and d you should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on answer sheet with a single line through the centre passage one questions to are based on the following passage depression is more than a serious economic downturn what distinguishes a depression from a harsh recession is paralysing fear fear of the unknown so great that it causes consumers businesses and investors to retreat and panic they save up cash and desperately cut spending they sell stocks and other assets a shattering loss of confidence inspires behaviour that overwhelms the normal self correcting mechanisms that usually prevent a recession from becoming deep and prolonged a depression comparing with christina romer the head of president obama s council of economic advisers finds the initial blow to confidence far greater now than then true stock prices fell a third from september to december but fewer americans then owned stocks moreover home prices barely dropped from december to december total household wealth declined only by contrast the loss in household wealth between december and december was both stocks and homes more widely held dropped more thus traumatised the economy might have gone into a free fall ending in depression indeed it did go into free fall shoppers refrained from buying cars appliances and other big ticket items spending on such durables dropped at a annual rate in s third quarter a rate in the fourth and businesses shelved investment projects that these huge declines didn t lead to depression mainly reflects as romer argues counter measures taken by the government private markets for goods services labor and securities do mostly self correct but panic feeds on itself and disarms these stabilising tendencies in this situation only the government can protect the economy as a whole because most individuals and companies are involved in the self defeating behaviour of self protection government s failure to perform this role in the early s transformed recession into depression scholars will debate which interventions this time the federal reserve s support of a failing credit system guarantees of bank debt obama s stimulus plan and bank stress test counted most in preventing a recurrence regardless all these complex measures had the same psychological purpose to reassure people that the free fall would stop and thereby curb die fear that would perpetuate a free fall all this improved confidence but the consumer sentiment index remains weak and all the rebound has occurred in americans evaluation of future economic conditions not the present unemployment is abysmal the recovery s strength unclear here too there is an echo from the s despite bottoming out in the depression didn t end until world war ii some government policies aided recovery some hindered it the good news today is that the bad news is not worse why do consumers businesses and investors retreat and panic in times of depression a they suffer great losses in stocks property and other assets b they find the self correcting mechanisms dysfunctioning c they are afraid the normal social order will be paralysed d they don t know what is going to happen in the future what does christina romer say about the current economic recession a its severity is no match for the great depression of b its initial blow to confidence far exceeded that of c it has affected house owners more than stock holders d it has resulted in a free fall of the prices of commodities why didn t the current recession turn into a depression according to christina romer a the government intervened effectively b private markets corrected themselves c people refrained from buying durables and big ticket items d individuals and companies adopted self protection measures what is the chief purpose of all the counter measures taken a to create job opportunities c to stimulate domestic consumption b to curb the fear of a lasting free fall d to rebuild the credit system what does the author think of today s economic situation a it may worsen without further stimulation c it has not gone from bad to worse b it will see a rebound sooner or later d it does not give people reason for pessimism passage two questions to are based on the following passage usually when we walk through the rain forest we hear a soft sound from all the moist leaves and organic debris on the forest floor says ecologist daniel nepstad now we increasingly get rustle and crunch that s the sound of a dying forest predictions of the collapse of the tropical rain forests have been around for years yet until recently the worst forecasts were almost exclusively linked to direct human activity such as dear cutting and burning for pastures or farms left alone it was assumed the world s rain forests would not only flourish but might even rescue us from disaster by absorbing the excess carbon dioxide and other planet warming greenhouse gases now it turns out that may be wishful thinking some scientists believe that the rise in carbon levels means that the amazon and other rain forests in asia and africa may go from being assets in the battle against rising temperatures to liabilities amazon plants for instance hold more than billion metric tons of carbon equal to years of tailpipe and chimney emissions if the collapse of the rain forests speeds up dramatically it could eventually release billion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year making forests the leading source of greenhouse gases uncommonly severe droughts brought on by global climate change have led to forest eating wildfires from australia to indonesia but nowhere more acutely than in the amazon some experts say that the rain forest is already at the brink of collapse extreme weather and reckless development are plotting against the rain forest in ways that scientists have never seen trees need more water as temperatures rise but the prolonged droughts have robbed them of moisture making whole forests easily cleared of trees and turned into farmland the picture worsens with each round of el nino the unusually warm currents in the pacific ocean that drive up temperatures and invariably presage droughts and fires in the rain forest runaway fires pour even more carbon into the air which increases temperatures starting the whole vicious cycle all over again more than paradise lost a perishing rain forest could trigger a domino effect sending winds and rains kilometres off course and loading the skies with even greater levels of greenhouse gases that will be felt far beyond the amazon basin in a sense we are already getting a glimpse of what s to come each burning season in the amazon fires deliberately set by frontier settlers and developers hurl up almost half a billion metric tons of carbon a year placing brazil among the top five contributors to greenhouse gases in the world we learn from the first paragraph that a dead leaves and tree debris make the same sound b trees that are dying usually give out a soft moan c organic debris echoes the sounds in a rain forest d the sound of a forest signifies its health condition in the second paragraph the author challenges the view that a the collapse of rain forests is caused by direct human interference b carbon emissions are the leading cause of current global warming c the condition of rain forests has been rapidly deteriorating d rain forests should not be converted into pastures or farms the author argues that the rising carbon levels in rain forests may a turn them into a major source of greenhouse gases b change the weather patterns throughout the world c pose a threat to wildlife d accelerate their collapse what has made it easier to turn some rain forests into farmland a rapid rise in carbon levels c lack of rainfall resulting from global warming b reckless land development d the unusual warm currents in the pacific ocean what makes brazil one of the world s top five contributors to greenhouse gases a the domino effect triggered by the perishing rain forests b its practice of burning forests for settlement and development c the changed patterns of winds and rains in the amazon area d its inability to curb the carbon

second time you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard finally when the passage is read for the third time you should check what you have written self image is the picture you have of yourself the sort of person you believe you are in our self image are the categories in which you place yourself the roles you play and other scriptors you use to identify yourself if you tell an you are a grandfather who recently lost his wife and who does work on weekends several elements of your self image are brought to light the roles of grandparent widower and citizen but self image is more than how you picture yourself it also involves how others see you three types of feedback from others how they see us confirmation rejection and disconfirmation confirmation occurs when others treat you in a manner consistent with who you believe you are you believe you have leadership abilities and your boss put you in charge of a new work team on the other hand rejection occurs when others treat you in a manner that your self definition pierre salinger was appointed senator from california but lost his first election he thought he was a good public official but the voters obviously thought otherwise their vote was inconsistent with his the third type of feedback is disconfirmation which occurs when others fail to respond to your notion of self by responding neutrally a student writes what he thinks is an excellent composition but the teacher writes no encouraging remarks rather than how others classify you consider how you identify yourself the way in which you identify yourself is the best reflection of your self image part reading comprehension section a directions in this section there is a passage with ten blanks you are required to select one

following passage proper street behaviour in the united states requires a nice balance of attention and inattention you are supposed to look at a passerby just enough to show that you are aware of his if you look too little you appear haughty too much and you are inquisitive usually what happens is that people eye each other until they are about eight feet apart at which point both cast down their eyes sociologist erving goffman describes this as a kind of of lights much of eye behaviour is so that we react to it only on the intuitive level the next time you have a conversation with someone who makes you feel liked notice what he does with his eyes chances are he looks at you more often than is usual with a little longer than the normal you this as a sign a polite one that he is interested in you as a person rather than just in the topic of conversation probably you also feel that he is both self confident and sincere all this has been demonstrated in experiments subjects sit and talk in the psychologist s laboratory of the fact that their eye behaviour is being observed from a one way vision screen in one fairly typical experiment subjects were to cheat while performing a task

sheet a nation that s losing its toolbox a the scene inside the home depot on weyman avenue here would give the old time american craftsman pause in aisle is precut plastic flooring the glue already in place in aisle are prefabricated windows stacked near the checkout counters and as colourful as a fisher price toy is a not so serious looking power tool a battery operated saw and drill combination and if you don t want to do it yourself head to aisle or aisle where a help desk will arrange for an installer b it s all very handy stuff i guess a convenient way to be a do it yourselfer without being all that good with tools but at a time when the american factory seems to be a shrinking presence and when good manufacturing jobs have vanished perhaps never to return there is something deeply troubling about this dilution of american craftsmanship c this isn t a lament or not merely a lament for bygone times it s a social and cultural issue as well as an economic one the home depot approach to craftsmanship simplify it dumb it down hire a contractor is one signal that mastering tools and working with one s hands is receding in america as a hobby as a valued skill as a cultural influence that shaped thinking and behaviour in vast sections of the country d that should be a matter of concern in a presidential election year yet neither barack obama nor mitt romney promotes himself as tool savvy presidential timber in the mold of a jimmy carter a skilled carpenter and cabinet maker the obama administration does worry publicly about manufacturing a first cousin of craftsmanship when the ford motor company for example recently announced that it was bringing some production home the white house cheered when you see things like ford moving new production from mexico to detroit instead of the other way around you know things are changing says gene sperling director of the national economic council e ask the administration or the republicans or most academics why america needs more manufacturing and they respond that manufacturing gives birth to innovation brings down the trade deficit strengthens the dollar generates jobs arms the military and brings about a recovery from recession but rarely if ever do they publicly take the argument a step further asserting that a growing manufacturing sector encourages craftsmanship and that craftsmanship is if not a birthright then a vital ingredient of the american self image as a can do inventive we can make anything people f traditional vocational training in public high schools is gradually declining stranding thousands of young people who seek training for a craft without going to college colleges for their part have since graduated fewer chemical mechanical industrial and metallurgical engineers partly in response to the reduced role of manufacturing a big employer of them the decline started in the s when manufacturing generated a sturdy of the national income or gross domestic product and employed one third of the workforce today factory output generates just of gdp and employs barely of the nation s workers g mass layoffs and plant closings have drawn plenty of headlines and public debate over the years and they still occasionally do but the damage to skill and craftsmanship what s needed to build a complex airliner or a tractor or for a worker to move up from assembler to machinist to supervisor went largely unnoticed h in an earlier generation we lost our connection to the land and now we are losing our connection to the machinery we depend on says michael hout a sociologist at the university of california berkeley people who work with their hands he went on are doing things today that we call service jobs in restaurants and laundries or in medical technology and the like i that s one explanation for the decline in traditional craftsmanship lack of interest is another the big money is in fields like finance starting in the s skill in finance grew in importance and as depicted in the news media and the movies became a more appealing source of income by last year wall street traders bankers and those who deal in real estate generated of the national income double their share in the s and warren buffett the good natured financier became a homespun folk hero without the tools and overalls j young people grow up without developing the skills to fix things around the house says richard curtin director of the thomson reuters university of michigan surveys of consumers they know about computers of course but they don t know how to build them k manufacturing s shrinking presence undoubtedly helps explain the decline in craftsmanship if only because many of the nation s assembly line workers were skilled in craft work if not on the job then in their spare time in a late s study of blue collar employees at a general motors plant now closed in linden nj the sociologist ruth milkman of city university of new york found that many line workers in their off hours did home renovation and other skilled work i have often thought ms milkman says that these extracurricular jobs were an effort on the part of the workers to regain their dignity after suffering the degradation of repetitive assembly line work in the factory l craft work has higher status in nations like germany which invests in apprenticeship programmes for high school students corporations in germany realised that there was an interest to be served economically and patriotically in building up a skilled labour force at home we never had that ethos says richard sennett a new york university sociologist who has written about the connection of craft and culture m the damage to american craftsmanship seems to parallel the steep slide in manufacturing employment though the decline started in the s it became much steeper beginning in since then some million jobs or one third of the workforce in manufacturing have been lost a stated goal of the obama administration is to restore a big chunk of this employment along with the multitude of skills that many of the jobs required n as for craftsmanship itself the issue is how to preserve it as a valued skill in the general population ms milkman the sociologist argues that american craftsmanship isn t disappearing as quickly as some would argue that it has instead shifted to immigrants pride in craft it is alive in the immigrant world she says o sol axelrod the manager of the home depot here fittingly learned to fix his own car as a teenager even changing the brakes now he finds immigrant craftsmen gathered in abundance outside his store in the early morning waiting for it to open so they can buy supplies for the day s work as contractors skilled day laborers also mostly immigrants wait quietly in hopes of being hired by the contractors mr axelrod also says the recession and persistently high unemployment have forced many people to try to save money by doing more themselves and home depot in response offers classes in fixing water taps and other simple repairs the teachers are store employees many of them older and semi retired from a skilled trade or laid off our customers may not be building cabinets or outdoor decks we try to do that for them mr axelrod says but some are trying to build up skill so they can do more for themselves in these hard times mastering tools and working with one s hands shapes people s thinking and behaviour the factor that people can earn more money in fields other than manufacturing contributes to the decline in traditional craftsmanship according to the author manufacturing encourages craftsmanship according to ruth milkman american craftsmanship instead of disappearing is being taken up by immigrants the white house welcomed ford s announcement to bring some production back to america according to mr axelrod of home depot people are trying to ride out the recession by doing more themselves america s manufacturing in the s constituted of the gross domestic product in ruth milkman s opinion many assembly line workers did home renovation and other skilled work in their off hours in order to regain their dignity the author felt troubled about the weakening of american craftsmanship compared with that in america the status of craft work in germany is higher section c directions there are passages in this section each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements for each of them there are four choices marked a b c and d you should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on answer sheet with a single line through the centre passage one questions to are based on the following passage the report from the bureau of labour statistics was just as gloomy as anticipated unemployment in january jumped to a year high of percent as jobs were slashed from u s payrolls in the worst single month decline since december with million jobs lost in the last three months there is urgent desire to boost the economy as quickly as possible but washington would do well to take a deep breath before reacting to the grim numbers collectively we rely on the unemployment figures and other statistics to frame our sense of reality they are a vital part of an array of data that we use to assess if we re doing well or doing badly and that in turn shapes government policies and corporate budgets and personal spending decisions the problem is that the statistics aren t an objective measure of reality they are simply a best approximation directionally they capture the trends but the idea that we know precisely how many are unemployed is a myth that makes finding a solution all the more difficult first there is the way the data is assembled the official unemployment rate is the product of a telephone survey of about homes there is another survey sometimes referred to as the payroll survey that assesses businesses based on their reported payrolls both surveys have problems the payroll survey can easily double count someone if you are one person with two jobs you show up as two workers the payroll survey also doesn t capture the number of self employed and so says little about how many people are generating an independent income the household survey has a larger problem when asked straightforwardly people tend to lie or shade the truth when the subject is sex money or employment if you get a call and are asked if you re employed and you say yes you re employed if you say no however it may surprise you to learn that you are only unemployed if you ve been actively looking for work in the past four weeks otherwise you are marginally attached to the labour force and not actually unemployed the urge to quantify is embedded in our society but the idea that statisticians can then capture an objective reality isn t just impossible it also leads to serious misjudgments democrats and republicans can and will take sides on a number of issues but a more crucial concern is that both are basing major policy decisions on guesstimates rather than looking at the vast wealth of raw data with a critical eye and an open mind what do we learn from the first paragraph a the us economic situation is going from bad to worse b washington is taking drastic measures to provide more jobs c the us government is slashing more jobs from its payrolls d the recent economic crisis has taken the us by surprise what does the author think of the unemployment figures and other statistics a they form a solid basis for policy making c they signal future economic trends b they represent the current situation d they do not fully reflect the reality one problem with the payroll survey is that a it does not include all the businesses c it magnifies the number of the jobless b it fails to count in the self employed d it does not treat all companies equally the household survey can be faulty in that a people tend to lie when talking on the phone b not everybody is willing or ready to respond c some people won t provide truthful information d the definition of unemployment is too broad at the end of the passage the author suggests that a statisticians improve their data assembling methods b decision makers view the statistics with a critical eye c politicians listen more before making policy decisions d democrats and republicans cooperate on crucial issues passage two questions to are based on the following passage at some point in someone probably in either asia or africa made the decision to move from the countryside to the city this nameless person pushed the human race over a historic threshold for it was in that year that mankind became for the first time in its history a predominantly urban species it is a trend that shows no sign of slowing demographers reckon that three quarters of humanity could be city dwelling by with most of the increase coming in the fast growing towns of asia and africa migrants to cities are attracted by plentiful jobs access to hospitals and education and the ability to escape the boredom of a farmer s agricultural life those factors are more than enough to make up for the squalor disease and spectacular poverty that those same migrants must often at first endure when they become urban dwellers it is the city that inspires the latest book from peter smith his main thesis is that the buzz of urban life and the opportunities it offers for cooperation and collaboration is what attracts people to the city which in turn makes cities into the engines of art commerce science and progress this is hardly revolutionary but it is presented in a charming format mr smith has written a breezy guidebook with a series of short chapters dedicated to specific aspects of urbanity parks say or the various schemes that have been put forward over the years for building the perfect city the result is a sort of high quality unusually rigorous coffee table book designed to be dipped into rather than read from beginning to end in the chapter on skyscrapers for example mr smith touches on construction methods the revolutionary invention of the automatic lift the practicalities of living in the sky and the likelihood that as cities become more crowded apartment living will become the norm but there is also time for brief diversions onto bizarre ground such as a discussion of the skyscraper index which holds that a boom in skyscraper construction is a foolproof sign of an imminent recession one obvious criticism is that the price of breadth is depth many of mr smith s essays raise as many questions as they answer although that can indeed be frustrating this is probably the only way to treat so grand a topic the city is the building block of civilisation and of almost everything people do a guidebook to the city is really therefore a guidebook to how a large and ever growing chunk of humanity chooses to live mr smiths book serves as an excellent introduction to a vast subject and will suggest plenty of further lines of inquiry in what way is the year historic a for the first time in history urban people outnumbered rural people b an influential figure decided to move from the countryside to the city c it is in this year that urbanisation made a start in asia and africa d the population increase in cities reached a new peak in asia and africa what does the author say about urbanisation a its impact is not easy to predict c it is a milestone in human progress b its process will not slow down d it aggravates the squalor of cities how does the author comment on peter smith s new book a it is but an ordinary coffee table book c it serves as a guide to art and commerce b it is flavoured with humorous stories d it is written in a lively and interesting style what does the author say in the chapter on skyscrapers a the automatic lift is indispensable in skyscrapers b people enjoy living in skyscrapers with a view c skyscrapers are a sure sign of a city s prosperity d recession closely follows a skyscraper boom what may be one criticism of mr smith s book a it does not really touch on anything serious b it is too long for people to read from cover to cover c it does not deal with any aspect of city life in depth d it fails to provide sound advice to city dwellers part iv translation directions for this part
